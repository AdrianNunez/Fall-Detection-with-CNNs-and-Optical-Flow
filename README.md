We provide the following material to replicate the experiments.

### Getting started

The repository contains the following files:

* **temporalnetxxx.py**: there are four scripts with this name, three of those are specific to a dataset (URFD, FDD and Multicam) and the remaining one, **temporalnetgeneral.py** it is the code for the experiment shown in the section 4.6 of the paper (a multi-tasking training with the previous three datasets). The four scripts do a feed-forward pass through the VGG16 of the optical flow stacks generated from the images of those datasets to get their features (downloadable below). Then, they fine-tune three fully-connected layers with those features to correctly classify actions.

* **vgg16module.py** contains the VGG16 architecture in Keras.

* **brightness.py** contains the script to generate the images used in the experiment of section 4.5 of the paper.

### Reproducing the experiments

Necessary files:

* [Weights of the VGG16 network](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4i3D0pfGJjYNWxYTVUtNGtRcUE/view?usp=sharing). Weights of a pre-trained VGG16 in the UCF101 Action Recognition dataset using optical flow stacks.
* [Mean file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4i3D0pfGJjYTllxc0d2NGUyc28/view?usp=sharing).

#### 0. Using your own dataset

If you want to use your own dataset you need to have a directory with two subfolders: one called 'Falls' and the other one 'NotFalls'. Inside each of them there should be a folder for each fall/"not fall" video, where the images of the video are stored.

#### x. Reproducing the experiment with different lighting conditions (Section 4.5 of the paper)

**brightness.py** is required to darken or adding a lighting change to the original images of any dataset. 

1. Change the variables 'data_folder' and 'output_path' at the top of the script to match with the path to your dataset and the outputh path you desire.

2. The 'mode' variable can have the value 'darken' to obtain the images for the experiment 4.5.1 (darkened images). Any other value will retrieve the images for the experiment 4.5.2 (lighting change).

3. You can also change the amount of darkness is added and the intensity of the added dynamic light applied. The variables 'darkness' and 'brightness' will control them, respectively.

### Extracted features and labels

These are the features extracted from the fc6 layer of the VGG16 network used for fine-tuning (vectors of size 4096). The instances are ordered so that the i-th element in the feature file has the i-th label of the labels file. For the Multicam dataset, the division inside each file is done by scenes, then by cameras.
